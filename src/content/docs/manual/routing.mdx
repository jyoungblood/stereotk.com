title: Routing & Rendering
---

Stereo comes with a convenient [rendering package](https://github.com/jyoungblood/stereo-render) for easily responding to HTTP requests using [Slim's routing system](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v4/objects/routing.html).

All your backend stuff will go in the 'routes' folder. And OMG check this out: add a new file in this dir and that's it (no need to register, we got automatic file inclusion, cool!)

// examples of receiving requests (normal get/post/etc w/ slim)

// examples of rendering responses with stereo-render (html, json, blade, etc)

NOTE - nothing is stopping you from making a 'app/controllers' folder and writing your own classes for controllers. That's really up to you, it's easy enough to do that [maybe have a little example that's like "look, I did here. bfd"]

Same thing with models, bring your own, install doctrine and make an app/models folder, idgaf. Here's an example of if you did that idk.
