Stereo is a practical bundle of frameworks and utilities, pre-wired and ready for use. It's a full stack web development tool kit designed to make the process of building dynamic server-rendered web applications significantly easier and more enjoyable.


The tools:

- [Slim v4](https://www.slimframework.com/) (w/ [Slim PSR-7](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Psr7))
- [Blade templating](https://laravel.com/docs/blade) - using [BladeOne](https://github.com/EFTEC/BladeOne) and [BladeOne HTML](https://github.com/EFTEC/BladeOneHtml)
- View rendering helpers - [Stereo Render](https://github.com/jyoungblood/stereo-render)
- Database handlers - [DB Kit](https://github.com/jyoungblood/db-kit)
- Cookie handlers - [Cookie](https://github.com/delight-im/PHP-Cookie)
- Simple HTTP client - [HTTP Request](https://github.com/jyoungblood/http-request)
- Misc utility functions - [X-Utilities](https://github.com/jyoungblood/x-utilities)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) & [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) integration coming soon

This toolkit also provides a very simple application structure [boilerplate/skeleton] and (forthcoming) opinions and methodology for developing applications quickly using these tools. These process are not dogmatic, but aim to provide helpful suggestions for "next steps" and answers for how to build specific kinds of functionality.

In the future this will be a central resource for copy/paste components, links to resources, etc.

...all in due time, of course. I'm only one guy and I have a pretty busy life.

Stereo has developed slowly over the last fifteen-ish years and I'm finally getting around to making it more user-friendly to those who could benefit. [Drop me an email](mailto:jonathan.youngblood@gmail.com) if you'd like to get involved.

## ETHOS / GOALS

- reliable "pre-wired" base system built with technology that isn't changing all the time (using old "boring" tech, common sense workflow)
- low learning curve
- productive workflow (that's fun [/ not a drag] but also responsible)
- application / structure that's easy to understand (and modify, maintain) (simple structure, focused on business logic)
- Encouraging expedient technical decisions - focused on making shit happen [providing business value] fast, do what you need to do and don't worry about, focus on solving a problem / meeting functional requirement (business logic) in the fastest and easiest way Favor practicality over perceived correctness

**the un-framework** — it has the opinions of a framework, but it's not actually a framework

**all this complexity** — is it really necessary?
